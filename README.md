1. Use ColumnTransformer to apply different preprocessing to different columns <a href="notebooks/01_columntransformer.ipynb"><img src="icons/nb.svg" width="20px" align="top" title="View code"></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justmarkham_sklearntips-machinelearning-python-activity-6645311881470885889-F-dm/"><img src="icons/in.svg" width="20px" align="top" title="Discuss"></a>
2. Seven ways to select columns using ColumnTransformer
3. What is the difference between "fit" and "transform"?
4. Use "fit_transform" on training data, but "transform" (only) on testing/new data
5. Four reasons to use scikit-learn (not pandas) for ML preprocessing
6. Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder or OrdinalEncoder
7. Handle unknown categories with OneHotEncoder by encoding them as zeros
8. Use Pipeline to chain together multiple steps
9. Add a missing indicator to encode "missingness" as a feature

## Who creates these tips?

Hi! I'm Kevin Markham, the founder of [Data School](https://www.dataschool.io). I've been teaching data science in Python since 2014. I create these tips because I love using scikit-learn and I want to help others use it more effectively.

## How can I learn scikit-learn from scratch?

Watch my free video series, [Introduction to Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A). There are 10 videos totaling 4.5 hours, and each video has a corresponding Jupyter notebook. Here's the [detailed list of topics](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos#table-of-contents) that I cover in the series.

Due to changes in the scikit-learn API, a small percentage of the code shown in the videos is out-of-date. However, the code in the [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos) is all up-to-date.

## How can I get better at scikit-learn?

Take my online course, [Machine Learning with Text in Python](https://www.dataschool.io/learn/). It includes 14 hours of video lessons, detailed lesson notebooks, homework assignments with included solutions, access to a Slack team, and more. Here's the [detailed list of topics](https://www.dataschool.io/learn/#courseoutline) that I cover in the course.

The course is not free, but you can preview a small portion of the course by watching my [PyCon 2016 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiKMIuYidY0&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=10).

## Do you have any other tips?

Yes! In 2019, I posted [100 pandas tricks](https://www.dataschool.io/python-pandas-tips-and-tricks/). I also created a video featuring my [top 25 pandas tricks](https://www.dataschool.io/python-pandas-tricks/).
